Overview
--------

libva-epiphany-driver is the VA-API implementation for Adapteva Epiphany coprocessors.

This is a "dummy" driver or the Epiphany coprocessor, using the dummy_drv_video in the libva trunk.
The hope is I can get this to a resonable point using the exisiting documentation to reduce the
amount of work needed once the dev boards are available.

Codecs
------

None so far!


Requirements
------------

libva >= 1.0.16
